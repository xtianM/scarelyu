          <h1>Ghost Myths of San Juan, La Union</h1>
          <div class="content" id="content1">
            <p>
              A headless nun, a faceless cigar smoker, a mysterious white lady
              at the old tower—-these are among the spooky tales that itchy
              ghost hunters can pry into during a short stay in the coastal town
              of San Juan, La Union.
            </p>
            <p>
              San Juan was a quiet fishing town of La Union province in the
              North before the Americans came. Most tales are said to have
              originated around this time and handed down to generations. It’s
              still a quiet town, but pompous cottages and mansions have popped
              along its shores.
            </p>
            <p>
              Modernity has caught up among its very old Hispanic buildings,
              with a few shops and inns budding along the main highway. It is an
              8-hour trek from Manila by bus or private car.
            </p>
            <p>
              The eerie tales persist today, though in mumbled whispers by folks
              wistful for the past. The present generation would just shrug
              apathy on them. But now and then fleeting shadows are said to cast
              themselves on a chosen few—-perhaps just for a fun scare.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the myths goes that old historical ruins of a Spanish
              convent were burned by the Japanese and a nun was killed and
              beheaded. The old ruins of the covenant still stand. On some
              nights when an unfortunate vacationer happens to pass by on a full
              moon at midnight, some bell would toll spookily. It supposedly
              signals the approach of the nun from behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              First it’s a cool, creepy breeze. Then wavy long hair brushing
              against the nape. Looking behind, the victim would discover the
              spooky tale for himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another myth is that, before the war, youths around an abandoned
              man-hole used to smoke cigars at midnight. Once, a stranger came,
              face overshadowed by a straw hat, asking for light. When they lent
              a lit cigar, the man looked up to light his, showing a
              spine-chilling blank where a face should have been. The faceless
              man allegedly still shows up, though rarely, because he prefers
              unbranded, native tobacco to imported ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pristine beach of San Juan attracts foreign fishers who brag
              on their big catches of sword fish and tuna or "bariles" from the
              sea, which is also ideal for surfing. Old historical ruins of red
              bricks still stand there. It used to be part of a watch tower in
              pre-Hispanic times. A look-out sentry was posted watching out for
              pirates from the China Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the tales on it says, in an attack, the sentry alerted the
              whole town. A mural on this is painted on one of the walls of the
              town plaza.
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent times, tales say a laughing white lady is said to have
              been showing herself periodically in the old historical ruins,
              especially to handsome young men who brave the seashore at
              midnight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spooky tales of ghostly nuns, faceless creatures, and laughing
              white ladies may sound absurd and kids-stuff, but there’s always a
              child in us that want to find out. Well, San Juan, La Union is the
              perfect town to go spook-busting while checking out its historical
              old ruins and immaculate azure waters.

          <h1>Pindangan Ruins, San Fernando, La Union</h1>
          <div class="content" id="content2">
            <p>
              There's not much to see at the ruins of Pindangan Church, just a
              lot of lonely walls. But the story of the place is worth telling,
              and the loving care shown by the Carmelite Sisters next door (who
              own the property)--and who have kept it in what preservationists
              call "a state of arrested decay"--makes it that much more special.
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems that in Spanish times, there was a settlement up in the
              foothills of the Cordilleras, the mountain chain that dominates
              northern Luzon, main island of the Philippines, to the east of
              here.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are indigenous peoples living in these mountains to this
              day; but in those days, the 1700s, they were apparently not so
              "civilized" (whatever that means)--characterized as
              "headhunters"--and would occasionally raid the settlement, San
              Guillermo de Dalangdang.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, down on the coast at San Vicente de Balanac to the west
              of here, pirates--"Japanese, Chinese, and Moro"--plundered with
              equal ferocity, even taking away women and children.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so, in 1759, an Augustinian priest named Jose Torres prevailed
              on the people to merge their settlements--and their churches--at a
              safer place somewhere between the two, a place called Pindangan,
              meaning "a place for drying fish." The church at this new site was
              dedicated to St. William the Hermit.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1765 a new priest, however, suggested the inhabitants should
              change the name of Pindangan to "San Fernando Rey," after St.
              Ferdinand, King of Spain. The name stuck: it is the modern city
              where the church's ruins (and the Ma-Cho Temple) are located.
              (There may have been more than a little self-interest here: the
              priest's name is reported to have been "Fernando Rey"!)
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, an earthquake destroyed that church, and it was moved to
              another site, and then another. At last, it was built on the site
              of what is now the Cathedral of St. William the Hermit, on the
              Plaza in San Fernando, capital of La Union Province. This has led
              to the odd situation that a church dedicated to San Guillermo (St.
              William) is generally called San Fernando (Saint Ferdinand)
              Cathedral.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dates are hard to pin down, but it seems the walls we saw went up
              sometime around 1786; other sources say 1817. Wikipedia, however,
              says the original "abandoned walls" were razed in 1873 after an
              1860 earthquake (sounds fishy). There was also an 1892 earthquake.
              I honestly can't determine which San Guillermo Church these walls
              are the remains of--the first? second? third?--nor which year an
              earthquake caused its abandonment.
            </p>
            <p>
              But I can tell you that the ruins were covered in earthen mounds
              and heavy vegetation until sometime after the Carmelite nuns built
              their convent there in the mid-1970s. And I can say that this St.
              William the Hermit (also called William the Great and William of
              Maleval, or in Italian San Guglielmo di Malavalle) founded a
              monastic order of Augustinians, the Williamites. He died at
              Maleval, in Tuscany, in 1157. At least seven churches are
              dedicated to him in the Philippines; one of them, the unique
              "sunken church" at Bacolor, is not far from my home, and will be
              "visited" in another post.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are, naturally, two more--probably modern--additions to the
              story of the ruins. One is the apparition of a priest who was
              stabbed--I can't find out why, but does it matter?--and ended up
              headless, variously seen either carrying his head... or searching
              for it! (Did you get a chill?) Some claim to have heard his head
              calling out directions to his body to come find it. The other is
              the inevitable "White Lady," with a twist: this one is in a nun's
              white habit. Too bad we visited just after noon under a bright
              sky.

          <h1>Pagoda, San Fernando, La Union</h1>
          <div class="content" id="content3">
            <p>
              Local tourists went on a horror trip to several tourist spots in this city including an abandoned and haunted resort in another town for a ghost hunt to experience the mystery of how to be frightened, an activity during the Halloween here last Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
              About 89 participants including members of the “Kararua” tour group gathered at city hall for a brief orientation and designated rides. “Kararua” is Ilokano for soul or apparition of a dead person.
            </p>
            <p>
              The participants first converged at the St. William the Hermit Cathedral for a prayer of salvation, starting their first spooky or unearthly destination at Pagoda, a Chinese structure, at the Provincial Capitol Hill ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              The participants walked around the area with several lighted candles in the middle, where they silently prayed and held hands to enable psychic guides to contact the spirits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yari “Doc” Andaya, one of the tour guides with psychic ability, said that before praying he heard whispering voices of women and saw a soldier with complete uniform and chains on his legs. Two of the participants also experienced the creepy feeling and said, they saw a soldier carrying his chains and a woman in a rotten dress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Still at the Capitol Hill grounds, the tourists entered a mysterious tunnel believed to have been built during World WarII but it sunked several meters due to a series of earthquakes. The tunnel was used as a guerilla hiding place and the hill was a battleground for several groups of American, Japanese, and Filipino soldiers. Those who were killed, it is said, were buried in the tunnel.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also revealed that several people were killed along the hill including a girl named Angel Joy Valdez, who was found with a bashed face and stab wounds in the body and allegedly raped near a park in the capitol ground on April 11, 2012.
            </p>
            <p>
              Aside from Andaya, Aiko Nagas, also a psychic tour guide, said that the dead girl whispered to him in last year’s “Kararua” tour, also whispered to him that she was raped in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nagas and his associates lighted their candles and prayed for peace to the restless soul of the dead girl.

          <div class="content" id="content2">
            <p>
              Another abandoned and “decaying” resort called Cresta Del Mar, in Bauang town, was their third destination. In the 1960s, tourists, local and foreign, were drawn to Cresta del Mar along with Nalinac and Long Beach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The place was so dark, only the moon lighted the area. Residents near the haunted resort said that at sunset until midnight they see unusual things like a headless man or “pugot, ” Ilokano for a black creature, and a black dressed woman, a giant black man with a tobacco beard, also called “kapri”. Some tourists, they say, were able to take snap photos of a woman attired in black and a single hand with no clue as to which it belongs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The group members expressed fears while praying and lighted candles while moving around the area, feeling as if several spirits were whispering to them. Several balete trees are also found in the place and urban legend has it that a mythical environmental spirits, or “enkanto,” dwell in them.
